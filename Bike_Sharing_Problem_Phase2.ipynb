    "\n",
    "The code below defines a function named `daily_demand_distributor`, which is designed to distribute a given total daily demand for bicycle rentals among various station pairs. The function takes three parameters: `total_demand`, `num_stations`, and `distribution_method`. Here's a breakdown of the code and its functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import Statements:**\n",
    "   - The code begins by importing necessary libraries: `numpy` for numerical operations and `random` for generating random numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Function Definition - `daily_demand_distributor`:**\n",
    "   - The function aims to allocate the `total_demand` among different station pairs based on the specified `distribution_method`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Random Seed:**\n",
    "   - A fixed random seed (`random_seed = 42`) is set using `np.random.seed(random_seed)`. This ensures reproducibility of the results, as the same sequence of random numbers will be generated every time the function is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Demand Distribution:**\n",
    "   - The function initializes an empty dictionary `demands` to store the demand between each station pair.\n",
    "   - It then checks the `distribution_method` parameter and generates a matrix of random numbers according to the specified distribution (normal, exponential, lognormal, uniform, or poisson). Each distribution method uses different parameters like `loc`, `scale`, `mean`, and `sigma` to control the characteristics of the distribution.\n",
    "   - The diagonal elements of the matrix are set to 0 using `np.fill_diagonal(matrix, 0)`, ensuring that there is no demand from a station to itself.\n",
    "   - The matrix is normalized so that the sum of each row equals 1, ensuring that the distribution of demand among station pairs is proportionate.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Calculating Station-Pair Demands:**\n",
    "   - The function iterates over the matrix and calculates the demand between each station pair `(i, j)`. This is done by multiplying the matrix element by `total_demand` and rounding the result to get an integer value.\n",
    "   - These demands are stored in the `demands` dictionary with station pairs as keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Adjusting for Total Demand:**\n",
    "   - After the initial distribution, the sum of all station-pair demands might not exactly match the `total_demand` due to rounding. The code calculates the difference and adjusts the demands iteratively, either increasing or decreasing them by 1 until the total matches the `total_demand`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Return Value:**\n",
    "   - Finally, the function returns the `demands` dictionary, which contains the demand between each station pair as an integer. This output is structured to be directly usable as input for the `Pulp` optimization model in the subsequent steps of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function provides a flexible and efficient way to simulate realistic demand distribution scenarios between stations, serving as a foundational step for more complex optimization tasks.\n",

    "Using statistical distributions to model demand between bicycle rental stations provides a realistic and flexible approach to understanding rental patterns. Each distribution type captures different characteristics of demand variability and real-world phenomena.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale for Using Distributions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reflecting Real-World Variability:**\n",
    "   - Bicycle rental demand is influenced by time of day, weather, events, and user behavior. Statistical distributions provide a mathematical framework to simulate this variability and model potential real-world scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Modeling Different Demand Patterns:**\n",
    "   - **Normal Distribution:** Models demand clustered around a mean, such as peak hours or popular stations with limited deviations.\n",
    "   - **Exponential Distribution:** Suitable for modeling time between rental requests, particularly in less busy areas with spread-out arrivals.\n",
    "   - **Lognormal Distribution:** Captures demand that varies widely but clusters around a lower limit, reflecting areas with differing popularity.\n",
    "   - **Uniform Distribution:** Simulates a baseline scenario where demand is evenly distributed across stations without peaks.\n",
    "   - **Poisson Distribution:** Ideal for modeling the count of rental requests within a fixed time interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Facilitating Robust Optimization:**\n",
    "   - Simulating demand with different distributions tests optimization models under various scenarios, ensuring the system remains resilient and efficient despite fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Enabling Statistical Analysis and Prediction:**\n",
    "   - Understanding demand distributions allows for informed predictions, trend identification, and assessment of external factors on rental behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Customization and Flexibility:**\n",
    "   - The choice of distribution can be tailored to specific data characteristics or environmental factors, ensuring model relevance and accuracy as conditions evolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the number of stations and station-pair demands are unknown, employing statistical distributions offers a sophisticated method to model demand complexity. This approach enhances forecast accuracy and supports more effective operational planning and decision-making for bicycle rental systems.\n",

    "Now that we have our optimization model established, it's time to implement it in Python using the `pulp` library. This step translates our theoretical framework into a practical solution, enabling us to efficiently solve the bicycle distribution problem across rental stations. Here's a streamlined overview of how the code brings our model to life:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setup with `pulp`:** The code begins by importing necessary components from `pulp`, a powerful tool for linear optimization in Python, setting the stage for defining and solving our problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Defining the Function:** The `bike_sharing_model` function is our main workhorse, taking in parameters like daily demand, station information, costs, and capacities, which are crucial for the optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Costs and Capacities:** Using dictionaries, the code assigns costs for procurement, stockouts, excess inventory, and redistribution, alongside station capacity limits, reflecting the real-world variability and constraints we must consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Problem Initialization:** An `LpProblem` instance is created to represent our optimization challenge, with the goal clearly set to minimize the total operational cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Decision Variables Creation:** The code defines several `LpVariable` instances for bikes at stations, stockouts, and redistribution actions, ensuring they are treated as discrete quantities in the optimization process.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Objective Function Setup:** The total cost function is crafted to sum up all relevant costs, directly linking our decision variables to the financial impact of different distribution strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Adding Constraints:** Constraints are methodically added to the problem, ensuring solutions remain feasible by respecting station capacities, demand requirements, and logistical considerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Solving the Optimization:** With the objective and constraints in place, the `solve` method is invoked to find the optimal distribution of bicycles that minimizes costs while adhering to all operational constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Result Extraction:** Finally, upon solving the optimization model, the solution's status is assessed to ensure an optimal result was achieved or to identify any potential issues. Subsequently, the model provides detailed insights by extracting the values of decision variables, such as the optimal number of bikes per station, stock adjustments, and redistribution needs, enabling strategic management of the bike-sharing system. Finally, the minimized total cost is determined, reflecting the economic efficiency of the distribution strategy and guiding cost-effective operational decisions.\n",

    "\n",

    "The code below is exactly designed to do so. Like the last part, it optimizes the allocation of bicycles across a network of bike-sharing stations; But does it by applying different demand distribution methods and then summarizing the results in a way that informs managerial decisions, meaning one singule number of bikes needed for each station in general. Here's a detailed explanation of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setting Constants:**\n",
    "   The code, again, begins by defining a set of constant parameters that are critical to the optimization model. These include the number of bike stations in the network (the number of stations is chosen to be 15 to show even for a problem with higher dimension, this code works like butter), the cost associated with purchasing a bike, the range of costs related to stockouts and time wasted due to excess inventory, the costs for redistributing bikes between stations, and the minimum and maximum capacities for each station. These constants provide the framework within which the optimization model operates.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Distribution Methods:**\n",
    "   A list named `distribution_methods` is defined, containing various statistical methods ('normal', 'lognormal', 'uniform', 'exponential', 'poisson') that will be used to distribute the forecasted demand for bicycles among the stations. This allows the model to simulate different real-world scenarios where demand distribution might vary according to different statistical patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Optimization Loop:**\n",
    "   The code iterates over each distribution method. For each method, it initializes a DataFrame `results_df` to store the optimization results, which include the date, total demand, the number of bikes allocated to each station, the total cost of the allocation, and the status of the optimization process (e.g., 'Optimal').\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Daily Demand Distribution and Optimization:**\n",
    "   Within each iteration of the distribution methods, the code further iterates over a dictionary `daily_demands`, which contains the total forecasted demand for bikes on each day. For each day, the `daily_demand_distributor` function is called to distribute the total demand among the stations according to the current distribution method. The `bike_sharing_optimization_model` function then takes these distributed demands and the constant parameters to solve the optimization problem, determining the best allocation of bikes for that day to minimize total costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Constructing Results Rows:**\n",
    "   After solving the optimization problem for a given day and distribution method, the code constructs a row of results, including the date, total demand, the optimized number of bikes at each station, the total cost, and the optimization status. This row is appended to the `results_df` DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Storing Results:**\n",
    "   Once all days have been processed for a particular distribution method, the completed `results_df` DataFrame is stored in the `results_dfs` dictionary, keyed by the distribution method.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Calculating Weighted Averages:**\n",
    "   After processing all distribution methods, the code initializes another DataFrame `weighted_bikes_df` with distribution methods as rows and stations as columns. It then calculates the weighted average number of bikes for each station across all days, using the total demand on each day as weights. This calculation is performed for each distribution method, providing insight into how many bikes should be allocated to each station under different demand scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Displaying Results:**\n",
    "   Finally, the `weighted_bikes_df` DataFrame, which summarizes the weighted average number of bikes for each station under each distribution method, is printed. This summary offers valuable insights for making managerial decisions regarding the general allocation of bikes to stations, considering different demand distribution patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive approach allows for a nuanced understanding of how different demand distributions affect bike allocation strategies, facilitating informed, data-driven decision-making in managing the bike-sharing system.\n",

    "The final result presents the weighted average number of bikes allocated to each of the 15 stations under different demand distribution methods: normal, lognormal, uniform, exponential, and Poisson. Analyzing this data can provide valuable insights into how the variability in demand affects the strategic allocation of bikes across the network. Here's a detailed analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Demand Sensitivity:** The variation in bike allocation across different distribution methods indicates the model's sensitivity to demand patterns. For instance, the 'normal' and 'lognormal' distributions, which are more likely to represent real-world demand scenarios with a central tendency, show a relatively balanced distribution of bikes across stations. In contrast, 'uniform' distribution, which assumes equal probability for all demand levels, results in a more even spread of bikes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Station-Specific Allocations:** Certain stations exhibit higher allocations across most distribution methods, suggesting these are key hubs with consistently higher demand. In contrast, some stations (e.g., Station 7 and Station 13) generally receive fewer bikes, which might be due to their location, lesser demand, or proximity to other high-demand stations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Impact of Extreme Values:** The 'exponential' and 'poisson' distributions, which can include more extreme values due to their long tails, show significant variability in bike allocations. This is evident from the higher allocations in some stations under the 'poisson' method, reflecting the model's attempt to accommodate sporadic high-demand events.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Operational Implications:** The variability in allocations underscores the need for a flexible operational strategy that can adapt to daily demand fluctuations. Stations with consistently higher allocations should be prioritized for regular monitoring and rebalancing to ensure availability. Conversely, stations with lower allocations might require less frequent interventions but should not be neglected, as their demand could increase due to special events or seasonal changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Strategic Planning:** The data provides a foundation for long-term strategic planning, such as deciding where to place new stations or which stations to expand. Stations consistently receiving high allocations across various distributions might be candidates for capacity increase or infrastructure improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Resource Optimization:** Understanding the demand distribution's impact on bike allocation helps optimize resources, ensuring that bikes and maintenance efforts are directed where they are most needed, enhancing system efficiency and user satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Future Investments:** For stations showing high variability in bike allocations depending on the demand distribution, further investigation into local factors influencing demand might be necessary before making significant investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis highlights the importance of considering various demand scenarios in planning and operating a bike-sharing system. It also underscores the need for dynamic management practices that can adjust to changing demand patterns to maintain a high level of service.\n",

    "In conclusion, this project has adeptly navigated the complexities of optimizing bicycle allocations for a bike-sharing network, underpinned by robust demand forecasts generated through a Random Forest algorithm. Central to our endeavor was the development of a comprehensive mathematical optimization model, which meticulously balanced various operational costs against the dynamic landscape of forecasted demand. This model not only aimed at minimizing operational expenses but also ensured that bike distribution was finely tuned to meet anticipated demand fluctuations, highlighting the critical interplay between predictive analytics and operational strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exploration of diverse demand distribution methods further enriched our model's adaptability, reflecting the real-world variability inherent in bike-sharing systems. This nuanced approach facilitated a deeper understanding of demand dynamics, enabling the identification of key operational insights such as high-demand hubs and stations with lower allocation needs. Such insights are invaluable for targeted resource allocation, enhancing system efficiency and user satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the project's findings lay a solid foundation for future strategic planning within bike-sharing operations. The adaptability of our optimization framework to various demand scenarios and different parameters offers a powerful tool for informed decision-making, guiding the expansion and efficient management of bike-sharing networks. As urban mobility continues to evolve, the methodologies and insights gleaned from this project will remain pertinent, steering the sustainable and user-centric development of bike-sharing systems.\n",
